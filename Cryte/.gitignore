# Ignore some extra generated Wwise files, especially ones that can be rebuilt from the project
# source: https://www.audiokinetic.com/qa/1547/there-definitive-filesIntermediate-should-could-omitted-source-control

# as mentioned in link above
*_WwiseProject/.cache/* 
*_WwiseProject/.cache/**/*
*_WwiseProject/.cache
*_WwiseProject/**/.cache

# as mentioned in link above
*_WwiseProject/**/*.akd

# Don't track Wwise user settings
*_WwiseProject/*.wsettings

# For the GeneratedSoundBanks folder,
# some people don't place it under source control, some people do.  
# It depends on the your build pipeline.  
# In theory, these files can always be rebuilt from the project, 
# but some teams like to freeze them, and check-in them to source control. 
#
# (NOTE: We'll check them into source control, if these are like Fmod banks it will be convenient)

# Don't commit Wwise profiling sessions they're large and only needed on your local computer
*_WwiseProject/*.prof

# Definitely need to check in the Wwise plugin dll files so make an exception for them
# in case something else in the .gitignore is preventing them from being tracked
