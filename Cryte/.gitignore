# For the GeneratedSoundBanks folder,
# some people don't place it under source control, some people do.  
# It depends on the your build pipeline.  
# In theory, these files can always be rebuilt from the project, 
# but some teams like to freeze them, and check-in them to source control. 
#
# (NOTE: We'll check them into source control, if these are like Fmod banks it will be convenient)
